# Hopfield-Neural-Network
This repository contains the implementation of Hopfield Network using Hebbian Learning algorithm. The network is used as auto-associative memory for Image retrieval.

## Implemented Things
* Single Pattern Image retrieval.
* Multiple Pattern Image retrieval.
* Multiple Pattern Image retrieval by making X % of the weight 0.

## Task 1

**Image Visualization**

![](Images/Part_1/Ball.png)  ![](Images/Part_1/Cat.png)  ![](Images/Part_1/Mona.png)

## Task 2
Image of the ball is saved in the network.

**[a] Initialize a zero matrix of the same size as that of the input image of the ball and replace a small patch with a portion of the input image. Use this patch image as the cue for retrieving the image.**
